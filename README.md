Starter kit for those that facilitate Coding Dojos. Everything you need from tried-and-tested problems, easy-to-clone projects for commonly-used languages, and some advice and guidance on how to facilitate sessions.


## Starter Kits

These are designed to "get people going" as quickly as possible. Skeleton projects that are installed with most-commonly-used* packages for that language.

2. [TypeScript] (running on [Node.js][nodejs]), with [Jest][jest].
