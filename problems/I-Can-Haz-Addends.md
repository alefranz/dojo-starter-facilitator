# I Can Haz Addends? ❓➕❓✅

(Working title - naming is always hard 😊)

> 🔍 This problem was inspired via [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/).

Given an input of a collection of positive integers - `values`  - and a number `k` - return whether any **two** numbers from the list add up to `k`.

For example, given `[10, 15, 3, 7]` and `k` of `17`, return `true` since `10 + 7` is `17`.

Additional Notes:

* `values` can contain zero or more items.
* `values` can have repeated numbers of the same value.
