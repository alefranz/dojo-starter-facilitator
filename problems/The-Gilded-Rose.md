Originally created by [@TerryHughes](https://twitter.com/TerryHughes). [@NotMyself](https://twitter.com/NotMyself) took it and ran with it, creating a .NET starter project on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose).

[Emily Bache](https://github.com/emilybache) and [friends](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/graphs/contributors) have created [an amazing collection of starting points in a wide array of languages](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata).

This is an _excellent_ kata - one I recommend repeating often, with different people and trying different ideas.

We almost all live in a world where we're having to improve _existing_ systems. These systems are running and creating value - they pay the salaries and _"can't"_ break.

 These systems were likely created by someone else. Given many people in our industry move jobs every 1-2 years - they're often not available to help. We also all know what it's like going back to code _you_ wrote 12+ months ago ğŸ™ˆğŸ˜Š `#alwaysimproving`.

## Outline

* The focus of this Kata is **refactoring** - changing the design of the code, but _without_ changing it's external behaviour. This generally means either keeping - or adding - features - without breaking existing ones.
* Be sure to read the specification - and it's constraints - _thoroughly_ before starting!
* **Practice requirements:**
  * [Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) - this is how we ensure we don't break existing functionality.
  * [Pair Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) - this is how we best create code that is easy to understand and maintain. You can also consider [Mobbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming).

> â„¹ Remember, **code is for people** - readability, testability and maintainability are key.
